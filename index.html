        <h3>🔥 What is $LIT? 🔥</h3>
        <span class="par">
          Lit, as defined by the Urban Dictionary (which is the only dictionary
          we use), means: “When
          <a
            href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=something"
            target="_blank"
            class="und"
            >something</a
          >
          is
          <a
            href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=turned%20up"
            target="_blank"
            class="und"
            >turned up</a
          >
          or
          <a
            href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=popping"
            target="_blank"
            class="und"
            >popping</a
          >.”.” And turned up, according to the Urban Dictionary, means to be
          overly excited or enthusiastic about something. Something, of course,
          being defined as “a word you have looked up on Urban Dictionary
          because you were bored.” This should clarify any questions you may
          have about Lit. You’re bored. You want to get your wallet popping. And
          now you’re here.
        </span>
        <h3>💸 Was there a presale? 💸</h3>
        <span class="par">
          Presale = you are exit liquidity. There is no presale. Nor is there a
          stealth launch. The launch will be announced in our Telegram group. We
          will be unable to give an exact time or contract address not because
          we want you glued to your phone, but because of our anti-bot measures
          in place. If you’re reading this after launch, visit the links above
          to see how it went. And then hop in the Telegram group to watch
          everyone celebrate when the number goes up and FUD when it goes down.
          It’s how it works. What we can tell you is that we are here for the
          long-term. And we hope you are too.

        <h3>📝 What are the tokenomics of Lit? 📝</h3>
        <span class="par">
          There are <span class="color">100 billion</span> Lit tokens.
          <span class="color">50%</span> are for release on UniswapV3 at launch.
          <span class="color">6%</span> have been locked in a gnosis safe for a
          year, for team members who continue to work actively on this project
          and support the holders for the entirety of this time.
          <span class="color">4%</span> have been set aside for marketing. All
          marketing allocations will be linearly released, to ensure that no one
          has control over the price of the token. And because there’s no fun
          without risk, in the spirit of Shiba, we have sent the remaining
          <span class="color">40%</span> of the supply to that great patron of
          the arts Cozomo de’ Medici.
        </span>
        <h3>😨 You…WHAT? 😨</h3>
        <span class="par">
          Yeah, we did. After all, we’ve seen what happens when 40-50 percent of
          a token’s supply is sent to Vitalik Buterin. But we don’t know what
          will happen when that amount is sent to Cozomo de’ Medici. We only
          hope that if it is indeed Snoop Dogg, that
          <span class="color">$LIT</span> lasts as long as his career has. And
          that he doesn’t spend it all on weed.
        </span>
        <h3>🤔 Wen Roadmap? 🤔</h3>
        <span class="par">
          A roadmap is a promise that’s rarely delivered.
          <span class="color">$LIT</span> is all about under-promising and
          over-delivering. After all, it’s those nights when you don’t want to
          go out, and expect nothing, when you have the best time.
        </span>
        <h3>🕵️ Delivering what? 🕵️</h3>
        <span class="par">
          We discussed risk. The other component of fun is mystery. And what
          <span class="color">$LIT</span> will delivery is a mystery. Get
          <span class="color">$LIT</span> to find out.
